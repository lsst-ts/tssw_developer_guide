``pre-commit`` is a tool to automatically run software tools, referred to as ``hooks``, when committing code to a versioning control repository like ``git``.
See `the pre-commit website <https://pre-commit.com/>`_.

To enable this:

* Install pre-commit, for instance ``conda install -y pre-commit``.

The following pre-commit hooks are used:

:black: An opinionated autoformatter.
:isort: An opinionated import sorter.
:flake8: A style checker with many different plugins to enforce different rules.
:check-yaml: Checks yaml files for proper format.
:check-xml: Checks xml files for proper format.
:mypy: Performs type checking on the code (optional).

``ts_pre_commit_conf`` is a tool to generate configuration files for the ``pre-commit`` hooks for the Telescope and Site SoftWare (TSSW) team at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

These configuration files facilitate ``pre-commit`` to maintain ``black`` formatting, ``flake8`` compliance and ``isort`` imports sorting.
If ``mypy`` is used, a configuration file can be generated for that as well.
The configuration files are generated by using the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command.
Since TSSW uses ``conda`` (or ``mamba``) for their software installations, a conda recipe was created for this project and the conda package was made available in the ``lsstts`` conda channel.
To enable this:

* Install pre-commit, for instance ``conda install -y pre-commit``.
* Install ``ts_pre_commit_conf``, for instance ``conda install -y -c lsstts ts-pre-commit-config``.
* Then execute the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command.

In order for the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command to know which ``pre-commit`` hooks need to be applied, a ``.ts-pre-commit-config.yaml`` configuration file needs to be created.
This ``.ts-pre-commit-config.yaml`` file contains information that indicates for every ``pre-commit`` whether it should be applied or not.
The ``.ts-pre-commit-config.yaml`` configuration file can be generated using the ``generate_pre_commit_conf --create`` command, or manually.
For more information on the command line options, use ``generate_pre_commit_conf --help``.
An example where all ``pre-commit`` hooks are enabled is:

.. code-block:: yaml

   check-yaml: true
   check-xml: true
   black: true
   flake8: true
   isort: true
   mypy: true

The ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command fails with a comprehensive error message if a mandatory or optional ``pre-commit`` hook is missing.
All ``pre-commit`` hooks except for ``mypy`` are mandatory for TSSW projects, so those hooks need to be set to ``true``.
Setting one or more of the mandatory hooks to ``false`` will make the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command fail with a comprehensive error message.

The configuration files will be updated whenever the pre-commit hooks get updated.
Apart from that, all generated configuration file names get added to ``.gitignore`` as well.
The TSSW Jenkins CI jobs update these configuration files and execute pre-commit every time the jobs run, so you know that you need to update them locally and fix your code if a job fails.
You can update the config file locally by running the ``generate_pre_commit_conf`` command again.
